        Once when I was six years old I saw a magnificant picture in a book, called     <i> True Stories from Nature </i>about the primeval forest. It was a picture of a boa constrictor in the fact of swallowing an animal. Here is a copy of the drawing.

    <p>In the book It said: <i> "boa constrictor swallow their whole, without chewing It, after that, they are not able to move, and they sleep through the six months that they need for digetion".</i></p>
    <p>I pondered deeply,then, over the adventures of the jungle. After some work with a colored pencil succeeded in making my first drawing. My Drawing Number one. It looked something like this:</p>

    <p>I showed my masterpiece to the grown-ups, asked them whether the drawing frightened them.</p>
    <p>but they answered: <i>"frightened? Why should any one be frightened by a hat?</i> </p>
    <br>
    <p>My drawing was not a picture of a hat. It was a picture of a boa constrictor digesting an elephant. But since the grown-ups were not able to understand it. I made another drawing. I drew the inside of a boa constrictor, so the grown-ups could see it clearly. They always need to have things explained. My Drawing Number looked like this:</p>

    <p>So I lived my life alone, without anyone that I could really talk to, until I had an accident with my plane in the Desert of Sahara, six years ago. Something was broken in my engine. And as I had with me neither a mechanic nor any passengers, I set myself to attempt the difficult repairs all alone. It was a question of life or death for me: I had scarcely enough drinking water to last a week.</p>
    <p>The first night, then, I went to sleep on the sand, a thousand miles from any human habitation. I was more isolated than a shipwrecked sailor on a raft in the middle of the ocean. Thus you can imagine my amazement, at sunrise, when I was awakened by an odd little voice. It said:</p>
    <blockquote> <q> <i>If you please--draw me a sheep!</i> </q> </blockquote>
    <blockquote><q><i>What!</i></q></blockquote>
    <blockquote><q><i>Draw me a sheep!</i></q></blockquote>
    <p>I jumped to my feet, completely thunderstruck. I blinked my eyes hard. I looked carefully all around me. And I saw a most extraordinary small person, who stood there examining me with great seriousness. Here you may see the best portrait that, later, I was able to make of him. But my drawing is certainly very much less charming than its model.

    <p>That, however, is not my fault. The grown-ups discouraged me in my painter's career when I was six years old, and I never learned to draw anything, except boas from the outside and boas from the inside.</p>

    <p>Now I stared at this sudden apparition with my eyes fairly starting out of my head in astonishment. Remember, I had crashed in the desert a thousand miles from any inhabited region. And yet my little man seemed neither to be straying uncertainly among the sands, nor to be fainting from fatigue or hunger or thirst or fear. Nothing about him gave any suggestion of a child lost in the middle of the desert, a thousand miles from any human habitation. When at last I was able to speak, I said to him:</p>

    <blockquote><q><i>But--what are you doing here?</i></q></blockquote>

    <p>And in answer he repeated, very slowly, as if he were speaking of a matter of great consequence:</p>
"That doesn't matter. Draw me a sheep..."
    <blockquote><q><i>If you please--draw me a sheep..</i></q></blockquote>

    <p>When a mystery is too overpowering, one dare not disobey. Absurd as it might seem to me, a thousand miles from any human habitation and in danger of death, I took out of my pocket a sheet of paper and my fountain-pen. But then I remembered how my studies had been concentrated on geography, history, arithmetic and grammar, and I told the little chap (a little crossly, too) that I did not know how to draw. He answered me:

    </p>


<blockquote><i>"That doesn't matter. Draw me a sheep..."</i></blockquote>

<p>But I had never drawn a sheep. So I drew for him one of the two pictures I had drawn so often. It was that of the boa constrictor from the outside. And I was astounded to hear the little fellow greet it with:</p>

<p><i> "No, no, no! I do not want an elephant inside a boa constrictor. A boa constrictor is a very dangerous creature, and an elephant is very cumbersome. Where I live, everything is very small. What I need is a sheep. Draw me a sheep."</i></p>

<p>So then I made a drawing </p>

<img src="http://users.uoa.gr/~nektar/arts/tributes/antoine_de_saint-exupery_le_petit_prince/images/nemocnyBeranek.jpg" alt="a sheep" width="200">

<p>He looked at it carefully, then he said:</p>

<blockquote><i>"No. This sheep is already very sickly. Make me another."</i></blockquote>

<p>So I made another drawing.</p>

<img src="http://users.uoa.gr/~nektar/arts/tributes/antoine_de_saint-exupery_le_petit_prince/images/Beran.jpg" alt="another sheep" width="200">

<p>My friend smiled gently and indulgently</p>

<blockquote><i>"You see yourself, he said, "that this is not a sheep. This is a ram. It has horns."</i></blockquote>

<p>So then I did my drawing over once more.</p>

<p>But it was rejected too, just like the others.</p>

<blockquote><i>"This one is too old. I want a sheep that will live a long time."</i></blockquote>

<img width="200" src="http://users.uoa.gr/~nektar/arts/tributes/antoine_de_saint-exupery_le_petit_prince/images/staryBeranek.jpg" alt="and another one">

<p>By this time my patience was exhausted, because I was in a hurry to start taking my engine apart. So I tossed off this drawing.</p>

<img src="http://users.uoa.gr/~nektar/arts/tributes/antoine_de_saint-exupery_le_petit_prince/images/krabice.jpg" alt="a box" width="200">

<p>And I threw out an explanation with it.</p>

<blockquote><i>"This is only his box. The sheep you asked for is inside."</i></blockquote>
